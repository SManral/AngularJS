# AngularJS
Library management system using html, angular js and php

Smriti: Completed the login page, added the functionality for the librarian, general integration
Andrew: Created the table and click logic that goes with it, add the undergraduate view, general integration

Note: When the librarian adds a book to the library it gets added to the bottom but drops into correct place when the user sees it
